This is the Dynamicland website.\n\nDynamicland is a nonprofit research lab creating a humane dynamic medium.\n\nWhat that means is a way for real people in the real world to explore ideas together, not just with words and pictures, but with computation.\n\nReal world\n\nBut, for us, computation doesn't mean scrolling around in screens.\n\nIt means working out in the real world with physical materials. Putting computational programs onto ordinary physical objects.\n\nIt means computation integrated into real-world activities, from timbers to test tubes.\n\nIt means using our hands. Like playing a card game. Or like a board game. [1] [2]\n\nOr arranging scale models. Or building scale models. [1] [2] [3]\n\nIt means making use of physical effects. Using physical tools. Crafting physical tools. [1] [2] [3]\n\nIt means making use of space. Spreading out, getting everything onto the table. [1] [2]\n\nOr the kitchen counter. Or the walls. Or the floor. [1] [2] [3]\n\nOr the middle of the room. [more]\n\nSo, it's computation like electric lighting. Wherever people need to be, whatever stuff they need to work with. [more]\n\nThis typically makes use of projectors and cameras up above, although you're free to use any means of sensing and affecting the physical world. [1] [2]\n\nCommunal computer\n\nOne reason to be out in the real world is that's where the people are.\n\nBecause, for us, computation doesn't mean everyone inside their own computer.\n\nIt means people coming together in the same space. Getting their hands on the same thing.\n\nLooking each other in the eye. Being present in the same reality. [more]\n\nIt means everyone's work is out in the open, where everyone can see it. So, everyone's learning from everyone else all the time, and collaborations happen spontaneously.\n\nIt's like working in a woodshop or a communal kitchen.\n\nIt means having discussions where facts and data are on the table, so the discussion can be grounded in reality. [more]\n\nAnd computational models are on the table. Everyone can use the full power of computation to see what they're talking about. [more]\n\nSo, instead of a personal computer, this is a communal computer, designed for entire communities to work together in person. [more]\n\nAuthoring\n\nAnd here's the most important part of all this.\n\nFor us, computation doesn't mean apps, and it doesn't mean software developers. [more]\n\nIt means everyone making all this for themselves, for their own needs, and their own situations. [more]\n\nBecause a program is also just a thing on the table. [more]\n\nOr on the wall. [more]\n\nEveryone can see every program, and can see what the program is doing. [more]\n\nAnyone can change any program at any time, and see the changes immediately.\n\nA program can be in language, or it could be an arrangement of components. Or it could be a hand-drawn diagram. [more]\n\nAnything you can make an interpreter for is a program.\n\nPrograms tend to be very simple and small, because a lot of the work happens out in the real world. [1] [2]\n\nThrough physical means. Or social practices. [more]\n\nYou don't have to simulate a virtual world when the real world simulates itself. [more]\n\nSo not much complexity is actually necessary. [more]\n\nAnd that means that people can learn this by immersion. [more]\n\nBecause, in this environment, people are surrounded by programs. They're constantly handling them and remixing them.\n\nAnd they're surrounded by other people, working out in the open with everything visible, everyone learning from everyone else all the time.\n\nRealtalk\n\nThis includes all of the programs that make up the operating system. [more]\n\nEverything I've shown is taking place in our communal computing system, called Realtalk.\n\nAnd this is it. Realtalk is not a codebase. It's a poster gallery.\n\nOr a bulletin board. Or a binder. [1] [2]\n\nWhatever it is, everyone can see the whole thing, and anyone can change anything at any time. It's just part of the space.\n\nRealtalk is built entirely in Realtalk itself, out in the open with real materials. [more]\n\nWe don't use laptops to work on Realtalk.\n\nFor years, we've done all of our day-to-day work in Realtalk. It's a complete self-hosted computing system. [1] [2]\n\nEven this website is made entirely in Realtalk, and is actually a physical place where people can learn together. [1] [2]\n\nDynamicland\n\nOf course, you can't invent communal computing without a community.\n\nSo, the creation of Realtalk took place, not in some isolated lab, but within a public community space we started called Dynamicland, where large groups of people could come together to work in Realtalk and contribute back to it. [1] [2]\n\nThousands of visitors got to experience Dynamicland, through public events, residencies, workshops, field trips, and other community activities. [1] [2] [3]\n\nAnd the core community was drawn from local artists, scientists, teachers, students, organizers, all kinds of people, who filled the space with a library of dynamic media on topics that they cared about.\n\nSuch as...\n\nmaps and demographics, [more]\n\necologies, [more]\n\nrhythm, [more]\n\nharmony, [more]\n\ncolor, [more]\n\npainting, [more]\n\nanimation, [more]\n\nhistory, [more]\n\npolitics, [more]\n\nAfrofuturism, [more]\n\npoetry, [more]\n\nweaving, [more]\n\nfamily histories, [more]\n\nsignal processing, [more]\n\nmolecular cloning, [more]\n\noptics, [more]\n\nplanets, [more]\n\nstatistics, [more]\n\nsymmetry, [more]\n\ngroup theory, [more]\n\nthermodynamics, [more]\n\nquantum computing, and so on. [more]\n\nThis was a community we formed around Realtalk itself.\n\nAfter the space was shut down for COVID, we moved into integrating communal computing into an existing community of bioscientists. [more]\n\nCommunal science\n\nWe're now starting to build out our vision of communal science, which, for us, means: [more]\n\npeople from different fields working together in the same space. [more]\n\nBuilding models together on the same table. Learning each other's expertise. [1] [2]\n\nIt means computational tools that are real things that everyone can build for themselves and all use together. [more]\n\nAnd it means computation integrated into the world of physical experiments. Molecules and computation live in the same world. [more]\n\nWe're looking forward to transforming how science is done, both for scientists and for all people. [more]\n\nAgency\n\nDynamicland is nonprofit, and Realtalk is not a product. You don't buy communal computing. You don't download communal computing. [more]\n\nOur goal is to invent a form of computation which local communities of non-specialists can make for themselves. From the ground up, for their own needs, which they fully understand and control.\n\nA form of computation which is learned and taught, not downloaded and used. Like reading and writing, or mathematics, or the arts.\n\nNot a product, but a practice.\n\nLiteracy\n\nHere's the big picture. Democracy requires universal literacy.\n\nAnd democracy in the 21st century is going to require a new kind of literacy, for understanding and discussing systems that can't be captured in words and pictures.\n\nThings like the environment, equity, health, global economies. We're not going to solve these things in here. Or in here.\n\nWe're going to solve these things out here. Where we can gather around, as real people, and use computation to explore ideas together.",
