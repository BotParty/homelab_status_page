would be cool if uniforms could be functions

** data cubes
//gant chart for data cubes
//0. simple shader w/ dynamic uniforms
//1. 2d textures - sprites
//
//2. packing of data into 2d images for scatter plot
//   convert 15gb of 311 service requests into texture
//   first take a subset of 10% and then render onto map
//   then transform 15gb into column-based structure
//      then read columns as one texture, and rows as another
//      each pixel gets 2 texture samples
//      which should say "this service request" happened here
//         (geolocation) , (time), (classification), (id)
//      id = reference to all features/columns in dataset for hover ux
//    3d morph targets texture -> tween 3d-model of ball into cup
//    convert 3d model => 2d texture with pixels = xyz point in space

//then lidar scan = points which go into texture
//then columns to dedupe data
//then ....

//before implementing
//estimate how much loading time would be saved
//by converting 15gb - 27M rows w/ 41 columns
//into a map that loads asap.

Every day, 4.4 million vehicles  drive through nyc

//simulate 4 million points driving around nyc using traffic flow models

//layers for webgpu map of nyc

//cars - 4.4 million dots
// 27million service requests - h3 hex? heatmap, scatterplot(first)

//start with dots
//then heatmap
//then try hexes later


//use hexes to do route planning
//pick two points and show a heatmap of how far the car can travel ?

//im in south brooklyn, show color heatmap of
//based on time of day, and whatever

next year, weather, sanitation, any public data sets that would be useful for cars

//500 layers needed according to carmera
