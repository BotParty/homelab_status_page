We were fine before the pandemic. 

In person things seemed good. 

It was just the devices that got in the way.

 I did go back and read some of the emails and they were a little embarrassing to read. 

But I was trying to fix something that was important a few years ago.

 And I’ll spend the rest of my life improving how technology is designed. 

Phones and email are only 2-3 decades old. No one designed them humanely. 

Life is bigger than small rectangles and screens. Alan Kay’s research created 30 trillion in value. 

That’s almost 30% of the economy. 

That’s why I’m allying with Bret victor. 

Because he cared about people. 

He cared about things more important than money. 

Bret helped design the original iPad which is what the original iPhone was based on. 

I firmly believe that most conflicts between people are not caused by the flaws in people but systemic.

When everyone works together and shares responsibility for creating these systems, the future will be a better place.

Alan kay's original research was on "the office of the future".

He tooks ideas from Constructionism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory))

Alan Kay wasnt a computer scientist. He was a humanist.

He studied the theory of seymour papert, who observed children.

When children are 3, they don't have any concept of object constancy.

Thats why they are so surprised and happy when you play peek-aboo with them.

Before Alan invented the modern user interface, it was all text and numbers. only .5% of people like using machines like that.

But today, thanks to seymour papert, 100% of people kind of like computers.

But there's a significant flaw in all computing devices and the internet.

Everyone lives in a solipsistic bubble. A mirror world of their own design.

Technology as it is exacerbates the inherent flaws in the human condition.

Bret studied history, and he devoted his life to creating a humane dynamic medium.

Dynamicland is a "shared thinking space." A collaborative reasoning environment.

For the last 5-15 years I've tried to reason on problems that were beyond my ability.

Technology is isolating. Even in crowded places like new york, its easily to feel alone. Everyone's staring on their devices. 

My friend rosetti said "he spends his life staring at a screen, then comuting on a train and stares at a screen, then comes home and watches another screen on TV".

Thats why I'm devoting the rest of my life to supporting dynamic land.

It may seem like a toy to everyone here. It may seem like a joke or an impossible dream. But i'll never give up on dynamic land.

In 2022, Bret Victor and Shawn Douglass synthesized a vaccine in 48 hours with just 3 people.

By comparison, the Moderna Vaccine took 5,000 people.

I hope someday, in the future, everyone has access to their own personal dynamic land. Today there is only one.

But my goal is to build a dynamic land in every city on earth.

1 in 2024.

10,000 in 2030.

Bret's vision of the future is that there is no separation between creator and maker and user.

Everyone will build with their hands, and share their reasoning and externalize models of reality.

Like how kids intuitively love legos. Humans were designed to work together. We were designed to live in a world without hierarchy.

# Dynamicland is the best invention of decade 2014-2024

# For the next 27 years, we will support Dynamicland.
# Dynamicland is a 100x improvement to human cognition and scientific understanding of nature.

## The Vision
Dynamicland is a "shared thinking space" - a collaborative reasoning environment. Unlike today's isolating technology, it enables people to work together naturally, using their hands and sharing their reasoning in physical space.

## Why It Matters
- Alan Kay's research created nearly 30% of today's economy (~$30 trillion in value)
- Technology should be designed humanely
- Current devices create solipsistic bubbles
- We need systems that bring people together rather than isolate them

## The Future
- Goal: Build Dynamicland in every city
- 1 location in 2024
- 10,000 locations by 2030
- Creating a world where everyone can be both creator and user
