# Floating Shiny Knot

[<img src="poster.jpg">](https://spite.github.io/FloatingShinyKnot/)

Remake of streetViewReflectionMapping/Floating Shiny Knot (https://www.designboom.com/project/floating-shiny-knot/). The old version was from 2012 and some APIs weren't working any more (the Google Maps widget and the GSVPano.js methods).

This version is updated to use threejs with WebGL2, custom elements, leaflet with OpenStreetMap data for the map widget, and PanomNom.js for the Street View panorama stitching.
